                <h2>Thinking, Fast and Slow</h2>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Kahneman</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>  
                Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman explains how humans think using two systems: System 1 (Fast Thinking), which is instinctive and emotional, and System 2 (Slow Thinking), which is logical and deliberate.  

                Kahneman explores cognitive biases, showing how our brains often make errors due to overconfidence, loss aversion, and flawed decision-making. <br>
He explains the illusion of memory, where our minds misremember events, and the availability heuristic,<br> where we judge events based on easily recalled information rather than actual probabilities.  

                The book reveals how we make irrational financial, business, and life decisions due to subconscious biases. Understanding these patterns helps improve judgment, negotiation, and financial choices. <br>
Thinking, Fast and Slow is essential for anyone wanting to understand human psychology and decision-making.

                <h2>The Power of Habit</h2>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Charles Duhigg</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>  
                The Power of Habit explains how habits work and how they can be changed. Charles Duhigg introduces the Habit Loop, consisting of three steps: Cue (trigger), Routine (action), and Reward (result).  <br>

                He shows how companies like Starbucks and Apple use this loop to build consumer habits.<br>
 The book explains that willpower is like a muscleâ€”it can be trained but also gets exhausted. Duhigg reveals that the key to changing habits is identifying the cue and replacing the routine with a positive action while keeping the reward.  

                Through real-life examples, like how Michael Phelps and Tony Dungy transformed their lives using habits, Duhigg provides actionable insights into breaking bad habits and building productive ones. Understanding habits can improve personal development, business success, and leadership skills.
